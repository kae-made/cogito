# COGITO
A Supportive Environment for Practicing "[Conceptual Modeling](https://note.com/kae_made/m/m054c9f9f8b61)"
Modeling Support Features:
- Creation, extension, and maintenance of models in both diagrammatic and textual formats
  - Conceptual domain charts
  - conceptual information models
  - State models
  - Action models
  - Descriptions of operations and domain functions
  - Conceptual instance models
  - Bridge definitions
- Model simulation
- Automatic generation of various artifacts from models
- Document generation
- Model compilers tailored to non-functional requirements
- Support for building model compilers

The official name of COGITO is:
- "<u>***C***</u>onceptual M<u>***O***</u>deling and Translative <u>***G***</u>eneration <u>***I***</u>ntegreted <u>***TO***</u>olset"

—an acronym constructed rather creatively by extracting letters from each word.

## The Philosophy Behind Conceptual Modeling
COGITO’s modeling framework is refined and redefined from the [Shlaer-Mellor method (xtUML)](https://xtuml.org), incorporating extensive experience in embedded systems, IT solutions, and everyday business applications. It is further enriched by perspectives from [philosophy, logic, and mathematics](https://note.com/kae_made/m/m12bb08458a18).
Modeling is the process of recognizing, understanding, and describing the real world—including the world of thought. The models created through this process enable shared understanding and recognition among individuals. Therefore, modeling is not only essential for software development but also for achieving clarity and purpose in any endeavor.
To reiterate: modeling is recognition, understanding, and description. At its core lies the principle of “Cogito”—“I think”.

## Compatibility with BridgePoint
The Shlaer-Mellor method (xtUML) is supported by an open-source tool called BridgePoint. COGITO aims for maximum compatibility with models created using BridgePoint.
